# Q47 Prime Quadruplet Catalog — Complete for n ≤ 2×10⁹
# Q(n) = n^47 - (n-1)^47
#
# Each entry: 4 consecutive integers n, n+1, n+2, n+3
# such that Q(m) is a probable prime for all m in {n, n+1, n+2, n+3}.
#
# Entry #1 (n=23,159,557) is a NEW DISCOVERY from this work,
# recovered when the [10^6, 10^8] data gap was filled.
